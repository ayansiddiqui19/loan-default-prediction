Loan Default Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will default on a loan based on historical data.
I applied Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and trained multiple machine learning models to compare their performance.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values (filled with appropriate strategies).

Converted categorical data using Label Encoding.

Applied feature scaling where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized distributions of loan amount, age, education, etc.

Compared loan default status with multiple features.

Checked correlations between features.

Model Building

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%).

Tried multiple models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Model Evaluation

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1-score

Model Comparison

Compared all models and selected the best performing one.
